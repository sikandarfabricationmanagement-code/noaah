## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark blue (#192a56), mirroring the darker shade in the logo, to convey reliability and professionalism. This color will primarily feature in buttons and banners to align with the brand.
- Secondary color: Light blue (#3498db), extracted from the logo's lighter shade, will serve as a secondary color for highlights and interactive elements.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F4F8) to maintain a clean, modern aesthetic, with good readability for text.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif. Use for headlines and body text.
- Use modern, minimalist icons that complement the geometric style of the logo, to represent product features and certifications.
- Maintain a clean and organized layout with clear sections and sufficient spacing for readability. Mobile-responsive design is essential.
- Use subtle animations for transitions and hover effects to enhance user experience.
